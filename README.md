# Figma Node ID Extractor - Chrome Extension

## Overview

The **Figma Node ID Extractor** is a Chrome extension designed to streamline the workflow of designers using Figma. This extension focuses on extracting a specific portion of a URL, particularly the `Node id`, which uniquely identifies frames or elements within the Figma workspace.

## Purpose

As Designers, we frequently need to share specific frames or elements from Figma in the process. Manually selecting and copying the `Node id` portion of the URL is time-consuming and prone to errors. This extension automates that task, allowing users to extract the `Node id` with a single click, thus enhancing accuracy and saving valuable time.

## Features

- **One-click extraction**: Quickly extract the `Node id` from the Figma URL.

## Usage

1. Navigate to a Figma design and select the frame or element you want to share.
2. Click on the Figma Node ID Extractor extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
3. The extension will automatically extract the `Node id` and copy it to your clipboard.
4. Paste the extracted `Node id` wherever needed.
